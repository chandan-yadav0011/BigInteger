<h3>In C/C++, the long long int data type can handle a maximum of 20 digits. But if you need to store a 22-digit number, primitive types are not enough. To handle this, we can create a new data type called BigInt. In this work, several elementary functions have been applied to this new data, e.g.</h3>

<ul>

<li>two large integers to add</li>
<li>Subtract two large integers</li>
<li>multiplication of two large integers</li>
<li>Divide by two large numbers</li>
<li>Modulo operations on two large integers</li>
<li>Displaying large integers</li>
<li>Calculating the square root of a large integer</li>
<li>Compare two large integers to determine which is larger or smaller</li>
<li>Digit count in large integer</li>
<li>print a large integer</li>
<li>integers converted to large integers</li>

</ul>

<h3>The use of the BigInt data type includes:</h2>

<ul>

<li>Calculating large Fibonacci numbers </li>
<li>Counting large numbers of Catalans</li>
<li>find the factor of large integers</li>


</ul>

<p>
To use the BigInt data type, we use C++ strings to store the numbers as characters (in reverse order for better performance). Additions and subtractions involve special calculations with carry-over control. Multiplication is done by multiplying each digit in one number by a completely different digit and multiplying the result.</p>

<h3>The project includes the following operations on BigInt.</h3>a

<ul>
<li>Definition of large integers</li>
<li>counting numbers</li>
<li>Increase or decrease (North/East) .</li>
<li>Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of large numbers</li>
<li>Find the modulo and square root (integer floor value) of large integers</li>
<li>They are raised to a large integer power</li>
<li>Conversion of simple integers to large integers</li>
<li>Counting Fibonacci numbers to 10,000 (or 100,000, although slower).</li>
<li>Accounting for up to 1,000 items</li>
<li>Counting up to 1,000 Catalans</li>
<li>Compares large integers to determine their relative size</li>

</ul>
